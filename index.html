		<h1>About Brittany</h1>
		
		<p> For many years Brittany has freelanced in the graphic design field; learning many of the techniques and programs. Her main focus is in photoshop, but has developed skills in inDesign, a little of Illustrator and Dreamweaver. Brittany started at the age of 13 dabbling in photoshop and graphic design. Creating many creations for friends on Myspace, such as photoshopped images, DIV layouts, and banners, Brittany felt she needed more. Over the years she developed her photoshop skills, photo restoration, and photo enhancing. Brittany has dabbled a little in Web Design (this website), learning HTML, CSS, and a little bit of Javascript, and is willing to learn more. Below are links to her previous and current works.</p>
